					Auto generation of access logs and error logs through Cloud watch 



* Create an IAM Role with cloud watch full access policy attached.
* Create an ec2 amazon linux instances with the above mentioned IAM role.
* To push the logs of the ec2 instances to the cloud watch, we need to create an cloud watch agent in the instance.
* Launch the newly created instance with moba xterm and follow the below commands:-
	* sudo yum update -y
	* sudo yum install -y awslogs
	Edit the /etc/awslogs/awslogs.conf file to configure the logs to track. For more information about editing this file, see CloudWatch Logs agent reference.
	By default, the /etc/awslogs/awscli.conf points to the us-east-1 Region. To push your logs to a different Region, edit the awscli.conf file and specify that Region.
	Start the awslogs service.
	* sudo systemctl start awslogsd
	* sudo chkconfig awslogs on
	* sudo systemctl enable awslogsd.service
