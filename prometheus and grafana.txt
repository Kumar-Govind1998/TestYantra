prometheus
grafana:-

we will monitor our aws instance using prometheus and grafana

we use grafana for visualization and creating some dashboard.


Agenda:-

1] What is prometheus?
2] Intsall Prometheus amd configure Prometheus to monitor itself.
3] Insatll Node Exporter on other ec2 instances.
4] Configure Prometheus for the ec2 instances.
5] ec2 Service Discovery for Prometheus 
6] Install Grafana.

Prerequisite:-

1] Prometheus  ec2 instance (t2.micro)						Take 2 ubuntu instances
2] Node ec2 instance to monitor							1 for installing Prometheus and grafana
3] Security group configured properly.						other one is for target where we install node exporter	
4] Clone ( https://github.com/devops4solutions/prometheus-monitoring ) git repository.

Security groups configured on ec2 instances:-

port 9090 - Prometheus server
port 9100 - Prometheus Node Exporter
port 3000 - Grafana

What is Prometheus?

* It is an open source tool which is used for monitoring and alerting application.
* Uses PromoQL ( Prometheus Query Language ).
* Prometheus Server:- This is the central component that collects the metrics from multiple nodes.
  Prometheus uses the concept of scraping, where target systens ("metric endpoints") are contacted to fetch data at regular intervals.(Should be written
  inside the yaml file).
* Node Exporter:- This is the monitoring agent which we installed on all the target machines so that Prometheus can fetch the data from all metric endpoints.
  Prometheus pulls the data with the help of node exporter.
* Web UI :- The web UI layer of Prometheus provides the end user with an interface to visualize data collected by Prometheus.
  In this, we will use Grafana to visualize the data.

Installing Prometheus :-

	Now we install the Prometheus in one of the ec2 instance.

	1] clone https://github.com/devops4solutions/prometheus-monitoring repository.

	2] Run the install-install-prometheus.sh.sh script.

	The script will do the below steps:-

	* Creates a user and adds new directories:-
	sudo useradd --no-create-home prometheus.
	sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
	sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus

	* Downloads the Prometheus, extract it and put it in /usr/local/bin folder and finally delete the software.
	wget  https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.23.0/prometheus-2.23.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
	tar -xvf prometheus-2.23.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
	sudo cp prometheus-2.23.0.linux-amd64/prometheus /usr/local/bin
	sudo cp prometheus-2.23.0.linux-amd64/promtool /usr/local/bin
	sudo cp -r prometheus-2.23.0.linux-amd64/consoles /etc/prometheus/
	sudo cp -r prometheus-2.23.0.linux-amd64/console_libraries /etc/prometheus
	sudo cp prometheus-2.23.0.linux-amd64/promtool /usr/local/bin/
	rm -rf prometheus-2.23.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz prometheus-2.19.0.linux-amd64

	3] Now we will configure Prometheus to monitor itself using yaml file.

	Create a prometheus.yml file at /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml:-
	
	global:
	  scrape_interval: 15s
	  external_labels:
	    monitor: 'prometheus'

	scrape_configs:
  	  - job_name: 'prometheus'
	    static_configs:
	      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
	
	4] Now we want to run the Prometheus as a Service so that in case of server restart service will come automatically.

	Lets create a fail/etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service with the below content:

	5] Change the ownership of all folders and files which we have created to the user.

	6] Now we will configure the start and start it.

	7] Now open it on the browser.

Install Node Exporter:-

	To monitor your servers you need to install the node exporter on all your target machine which is like a monitoring agent on all the servers.

Configure Prometheus for the nodes:-

 	Now we will configure the Prometheus for our ec2 instance where we have installed the node-exporter.

	Login to the Prometheus server and edit the file /etc//prometheus/prometheus.yml

Install Grafana:-

	Once Prometheus is installed successfully then we can install the Grafana and configure Prometheus as a datasource.

	Grafana is an open source tool which is used to provide the visualization of your metrics.

	Steps to install grafana:-

	clone the https://github.com/devops4solutions/prometheus-monitoring repository
