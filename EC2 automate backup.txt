How to Automate AWS EC2:-
	We can take the backup of ec2 instances in two ways:-
1] Lifecycle Manager
2] Using cloud watch.




1] Lifecycle Manager:-

		With Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager, you can manage the lifecycle of your AWS resources. 
		You create lifecycle policies, which are used to automate operations on the specified resources.

	The benifits of taking back up of ec2 intances through Lifecycle manager are:-

	*Automated snapshot and AMI creation:-
	 Automated snapshot and AMI creation.
	 Create a policy that automates the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs.

	*Fast snapshot restore integration:- 
	 Automate the creation of snapshots that are enabled for fast snapshot restore. 
	 Fast snapshot restore enables you to restore volumes that are fully initialized at creation and instantly deliver 
	 all of their provisioned performance.

 	*Built-in cross-Region copy:-
	 Automatically copy snapshots that are created by a lifecycle policy to up to three AWS Regions.

	*Automated cross-account snapshot copy:-
	 Use cross-account sharing in conjunction with a cross-account copy event policy to automatically share and 
	 copy snapshots created by a policy across accounts.	


	Create a lifecycle policy.
	Select EBS snapshot policy.
	Go for volume or instance.
	Add an IAM role or else a new role will get added.
	Add the policy tags.
	Configure the schedule details.



2] Cloudwatch:-

		Create rules.
		Give Schedule timing for creation of snapshots.
		In targets, select ec2createsnapshotAPIcall.		
		Enter the volume id of the instance which needs to get backup.
